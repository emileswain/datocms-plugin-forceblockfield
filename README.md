# Force Block Field Plugin

Modula fields let you choose the Blocks you'd like user to be able to apply to you field, by setting blocks in the Validations View. 

However, when a user creates a new instance of the model, it still requires the user to manually add the block, even when it's set to required.

This plugin lets you automatically insert the blocks defined in the validators section of the fields edit properties
dialog. 

Add the Addon and then Select the blocks (matching the ones you've set in the validator) you want to automatically attach
when a new instance of the model is generated.

[Describe what your plugin does, and how users you can configure it! Screenshots are always welcome!]

##Issues
### lists all blocks used by model in Presentation View.
In the Presentation view, I can't determine which field your editing, so rather than just listing the blocks
you've applied in the validations view, it unfortunately lists all the blocks in currently used in the model. 

Hopefully, a better solution can be applied in the future. 

Selecting blocks that are not in the validations section, won't be applied. 

### Localisation
I think there is some jiggery pokery that needs to be done for localisation support, but for lack of documentation, I haven't a clue what that is.
Something to do with field_ids, and fields paths or something.
